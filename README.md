🧠 AI-Based Learning Assistant
Explain Like I’m 5 & Question Generator

Abstract
Understanding complex topics can be challenging for beginners and students. This project presents an AI-based learning assistant that simplifies complex textual content by explaining it in very simple language or generating the most commonly asked questions related to the topic.

The system accepts both text input and PDF documents, processes the content using Google Gemini Generative AI, and provides easy-to-understand explanations or relevant questions. The application is built using Python and Streamlit, offering a lightweight and interactive web interface.

OBJECTIVES

To simplify complex concepts using AI
